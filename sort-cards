# Sort Cards
Alphabetize 4 suits and create a list for each (clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades)
Make sure each card is assigned to its respective suit
Aces must be at beginning of its suit’s list
Kings must be at end of its suit’s list
Each card relative to its suit’s list must be placed in ascending order, above ace, where  ace = value of 1, jack = value 11, queen = value 12, and king = value 13
According to each suit’s list, do the following:
1.	If value of card is = to another card, place it 1 index above that other card
2.	If value of card is > value of previous card, place it 1 index above that previous card
3.	If value of card < value of previous card, put it 1 index below that previous card
Follow the above instructions until all cards have been sorted into its respective index and suits. Then place suits on top of each other starting with spades.
