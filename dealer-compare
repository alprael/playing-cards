#dealer-compare
compare list of cards to list of cards of another hand
 face cards got a value of 10, ace can either be 1 or 11 (if rank.getValue() >= 10, then card get value of 10.)
 Add up the values of each hand, if value is > 21, it's a bust.
 if hand = 21 and if length of hand is 2, that's blackjack (which is a definitive win.)
 however, if hand = 21 but length is over 2, not blackjack.
 if hand is > 21 and contains an ace, ace has value of 1, otherwise it's 11.
 Assuming hands aren't 21, if added value of hand1 is > the value of hand2 without busting, hand1 wins.
